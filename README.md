#  About Me
My name is Kevin and I graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Computer Science. I'm a software engineer passionate about building scalable, user-centric applications and solving complex challenges with technology. I love diving into the technical decisions behind products and servicesâ€”analyzing how they come to life and exploring how I would approach them.  

I have a relentless drive for continuous learning and growth, always seeking to expand my expertise, stay at the forefront of emerging technologies, and refine my ability to build innovative and impactful solutions.
